The **cerebellum** is a system of highly specialized neural elements many of which are unlike those found in any other part of the brain. The precise function of all this specialized machinery, which is replicated across many parallel channels and connects with most of the sensory and motor pathways in the brain, has been tantalizingly elusive since the seminal publication of many of its unique features ([[@EcclesItoSzentagothai67]]).

Although it is widely considered to be a motor control system, the cerebellum is anatomically and evolutionarily a sensory system, albeit one that is tightly interconnected with the motor system. It is clearly involved in learning, but exactly what and how it learns remains a topic of active debate.

We adopt a specific implementation of the **adaptive filter** model ([[@Fujita82a]]; [[@DeanPorrillEkerotEtAl10]]; [[@Cullen23]]), which filters out the predicted sensory signals generated by one's own motor actions (i.e., **sensory reafferance**) to provide a more stable and useful basis for motor behavior. The sensory predictions can also be used as a **forward model** ([[@MiallWolpert96]]; [[@Bastian06]]; [[@TanakaIshikawaLeeEtAl20]]), to anticipate the sensory consequences of motor actions, which can be used for further actions. These are consistent with, but significantly more specific than, the more general [[error-driven learning]] models originally proposed by [[@^Marr69]], [[@^Albus71]], and [[@^Ito72]], which remain the most widely discussed ([[@RaymondMedina18]]; [[@Shadmehr20]]).

![The location of the cerebellum in relation to other elements of the motor system. 5 is the spinal cord, and 6 is the brainstem. From Asan et al (2022).](media/fig_cerebellum_motor_system.png)

The cerebellum is located at the base of the brain, forming a kind of outgrowth of the midbrain ([[#figure_motor]]). It receives inputs (via the **pons** or **pontine nuclei**) from all of the major [[motor]]-associated areas of the brain, including the [[basal ganglia]] and the sensory-motor areas of the midbrain, and motor-associated cortical areas including primary motor and somatosensory cortical areas (M1 and S1). It also receives a wide range of other sensory signals, including a major projection from the [[vestibular]] system.

The cerebellar outputs, from the **deep cerebellar nuclei** (DCN or just **CN** in more recent terminology), project widely to many areas of the brain, including a major driving projection to the VL [[thalamus]] from the more lateral CN areas, which can provide a training signal to primary motor cortex. The possibility that the cerebellum is critical for early learning, but can then transfer this learning by training other structures including the cortex, is supported by the differential severity of early developmental cerebellar lesions ([[@BeuriatCristoforiRichardEtAl20]]).

{id="figure_outer_prod" style="height:15em"}
![The cerebellum is organized like an outer product, representing many different combinations of sensory signals, including motor efferents.](media/fig_cerebellum_outer_product.png)

Unlike the basal ganglia, neocortex, and thalamus, the cerebellum does not have a simple topographic organization that can be easily labeled in a figure. Instead, the primary function of the cerebellum is to integrate and compare signals across different modalities, so it is organized somewhat like an _outer product_ across its various inputs, with each region comparing one sensory input against another in all manner of combinations ([[#figure_outer_prod]]).

{id="figure_fastigial" style="height:40em"}

[[#figure_fastigial]] shows an example of this outer-product like organization ([[@FujitaKodamaduLac20]]), associated with the _fastigial nucleus_ (FN), which is the evolutionarily most ancient of the cerebellar nuclei ([[@ZhangWangZhu16]]). The FN is interconnected mostly with the medial _vermis_ region of the **cerebellar cortex**, which integrates different signals including [[vestibular]], somatosensory and interoceptive signals of relevance to different core survival-relevant systems.

Another representation of the thorough mixing of sensory signals in the cerebellum is shown in [[#figure_mossy-prjn]], plotting the terminal zones of the axon of a single **mossy fiber** from a neuron in the pons ([[@BiswasLuoSarpongEtAl19]]). This one sensory signal is distributed across many areas of the cerebellar cortex, and many such neurons also project down to the cerebellar nuclei as well. There are around 43 million total neurons in the cerebellum of the adult mouse ([[@SurchevNazwarWeisheitEtAl07]]), reflecting the huge combinatorial explosion of the outer-product organization, along with a major additional multiplier by the granule cells in the cerebellar cortex.

{id="figure_cortex" style="height:25em"}
![Terminology for the anatomy of the cerebellar cortex in the rat and human. The general evolutionary progression is from the medial vermis outward to the more lateral areas. Although the lobes have all been labeled, they are not very functionally relevant; the most relevant organization is the medial to lateral organization.

From Apps & Hawkes (2009).](media/fig_cerebellum_cortex_rat_human.png)

[[#figure_cortex]] shows the terminology for all of the different regions of the cerebellar cortex, progressing outward along the medial-lateral axis from the original vermis to the _paravermis_ and lateral _hemispheres_, which are involved in more fine-grained skeletal motor control. There are also unique areas known as the _flocculus_ (FL) and _paraflocculus_ (PF) which process the convergence of vestibular, visual, and visuomotor signals.

The stripe-like structure shown in [[#figure_mossy-prjn]] is due in part to a protein called _zebrin II_ that reflects an organizing structure for the long stripes along the length of the cerebellum ([[@SugiharaShinoda04]], [[@HawkesLeclerc87]]). Although the flattened version of the cerebellum is convenient for visualization, it is actually a massively folded structure, with folds going perpendicular to the long axis of the zebrin stripes.

[[#figure_cortex-nuclei]] shows the relationship between the cerebellar cortex and the different nuclei and areas of the **inferior olivary nuclei (IO)** (from [[@AppsHawkes09]]). There is different terminology for the nuclei names, with the names in the rodent going from _medial_ (i.e., the fastigial) to the _lateral_, with the _interposed_ or _interpositus_ and _interstitial_ nuclei in between. The lateral is the most evolutionarily modern nucleus (called the _dentate_ in primates), interconnecting with the lateral hemispheres, which are the areas most enlarged in humans. This is where fine motor control associated with highly dexterous hand movements is supported. The intermediate nuclei are involved in major skeletal muscle control of the limbs, which evolved in land-dwelling animals.

[[#figure_somatotopy]] shows an example of the somatotopic (topographic) organization of the parts of the cerebellum interconnected with the skeletal muscles, which are those interconnected with the interposed / interpositus (IP) nuclei. Whereas the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) cortex have a fully somatotopic _homunculus_ ("little man") organization, the cerebellum retains a more cross-product like structure with more widely distributed projections, but some measure of medial-lateral topography ([[@LuMiyachiItoEtAl07]]).

{id="figure_anatomy" style="height:30em"}
![The major anatomical features of the cerebellar cortex. The Purkinje cells (PC) send inhibition to the CN, which is the only output of the cortex. The inputs come via the mossy fibers from the pontine nuclei neurons, which then synapse onto tiny granule cells, which send distinctive axons known as parallel fibers to the PCs. Each PC can receive 150,000 or more parallel fiber inputs, via its extremely large dendritic arbor. Each PC receives exactly one climbing fiber from a neuron in the IO, which has been shown to drive synaptic changes (LTD = long term depression) in the parallel fiber synapses. From Ramnani (2006).](media/fig_cerebellum_anatomy_ramnani06.png)

Figure [[#figure_anatomy]] from [[@^Ramnani06]] shows the major anatomical features  of the cerebellum, many of which are distinctive relative to other brain areas. We will review each of these features in detail in the context of the functional model developed below. The basic circuitry in the cerebellar cortex starts with mossy fiber inputs conveying the different sensory inputs from the pontine nuclei onto millions of tiny granule cells, which then send a huge number of parallel fibers to the only output neurons from the cortex: the Purkinje cells. These Purkinje cells send inhibition to the cerebellar nuclei neurons, and receive climbing fiber input from exactly one inferior olivary (IO) neuron, which is known to drive learning in the Purkinje cells, consistent with the original computational models of [[@^Marr69]], [[@^Albus71]], and [[@^Ito72]].

Critically, this circuit supports largely _parallel_ processing across all the loops that are replicated across the entire cerebellum, with very little interaction among the different loops. The granule cell parallel fibers distribute the same sensory input signals efficiently across these loops, but each Purkinje cell output channel is largely independent. This means that other brain areas, principally the [[basal ganglia]] and especially the [[neocortex]], are responsible for integration and comparison across these channels in order to support decision making and the hierarchical organization of motor actions.

The main idea behind the model we adopt is that the primary function of the cerebellum is to provide a stable, effective basis for motor control by learning to predict the sensory effects of motor actions, and to _subtract_ these predicted sensory signals from the ongoing stream of sensory inputs ([[@Fujita82a]]; [[@DeanPorrillEkerotEtAl10]]; [[@Cullen23]]). The massive inhibitory projections from the Purkinje cells onto the cerebellar nuclei, representing the sole output of the cerebellar cortex, is consistent with this function. The net effect is that any residual sensory signals that have not been canceled therefore represent something beyond the consequences of one's own actions.

Many theorists have proposed this function for the cerebellum over the years, but somehow have not fully recognized the remarkable extent to which so many of the unique features of the cerebellar system fit with a fairly straightforward implementation of this function. This is likely because they have been focused almost exclusively on the cerebellar cortex, whereas many of the key players are actually in the cerebellar nuclei, which has been relatively neglected ([[@KebschullCasoniConsalezEtAl24]]; [[@HerzfeldHallTringidesEtAl20]]).

The _Nuclear_ model described in the next section focuses first on the computations in the cerebellar nuclei (CN), and provides a clear and simple computational function. This model shows how the circuits between the CN neurons and the inferior olive (IO) can directly compute the sensory prediction error that drives learning in the Purkinje cells, whereas most discussions leave this critical element under-specified and largely attributed to external signals. It also emphasizes learning within the CN circuit as the foundation on which the additional contributions of the cerebellar cortex build.

A major additional contribution that is built on this foundation is the ability to use the sensory prediction error signal to drive motor actions based on the anticipated sensory outcomes of other actions. This is consistent with the widely-discussed _forward model_ theory of cerebellar function ([[@MiallWolpert96]]; [[@Bastian06]]; [[@TanakaIshikawaLeeEtAl20]]). A classic example of this is the widely-studied vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) where eye movements are generated to correct for head motion, to keep a visual stimulus stable on the retina ([[@ZeeuwHanselBianEtAl98]]; [[@KimpoRinaldiKimEtAl14]]).

After presenting the Nuclear model, we compare it against other models in the literature, with the goal of understanding how the specific contributions of the cerebellum fit into the broader [[motor]] system, to support flexible, adaptive, and capable motor behavior.

## The Nuclear model

### Adaptive filtering

The predictive cancellation function performed by the cerebellum is known as an **adaptive filter** ([[@Fujita82a]]; [[@WidrowStearns85]]), which is a form of [[predictive learning]] that filters out what is expected or predicted based on other sensory signals, so that the _residual_ signal represents a "pure" sensory signal that clearly represents anything that is otherwise unexpected.

When you move any part of your body, especially the head or eyes, you create massive changes in incoming signals across all of your senses (i.e., _sensory reafferance_). If you did not somehow subtract these _self-motion_ sensory signals in your perceptual system, you would never be able to act sensibly in the world ([[@Cullen23]]). Everything would be in a constant state of turbulent motion, and you would never be able to coordinate a proper motor action based on all of these moving targets.

The evolutionary history of the cerebellum is consistent with this adaptive filter function, based on proto-cerebellar circuits and cerebellar analogs in other animals ([[@BodznickMontgomeryCarey99]]; [[@MontgomeryPerks19]]; [[@BellHanSawtell08]]; [[@Cisek21]]). The most ancient part of the mammalian cerebellum is essentially an integral component of the primary brainstem [[vestibular]] sensory nucleus, where it learns to subtract the effects of self-generated motion signals at all levels of the body, to produce a _pure_ vestibular signal that represents any remaining discrepancy from what would be expected based on the self-motion generated signals.

This pure vestibular signal is then something that can be acted upon effectively. If there is an additional sense of motion after all of your own actions have been accounted for, you know that you are slipping or falling or being pushed around in some way. Furthermore, this pure signal tells you exactly which way you should act in order to counteract the residual motion. When combined with other sensory inputs from vision, touch and proprioception, you can also figure out what the likely cause of the disturbance is, and thus condition your motor response accordingly.

{id="figure_env" style="height:20em"}
![The temporal envelope surrounding a descending motor command, with temporal delays offsetting from the start of the command. A cascade of ascending sensorimotor signals from the spinal cord tracks the unfolding of the motor action (reflections of actual muscle signals, proprioceptive muscle spindle fiber signals, etc). The vestibular signal reflects the head and body motion in terms of velocity and acceleration in three dimensions.](media/fig_cerebellum_motor_envelope.png)

As this example makes clear, the adaptive filtering by the cerebellum provides an  essential basis to enable sensible motor actions to be generated. A major challenge that the cerebellum must overcome is managing the many different **temporal delays** associated with the effects of motor actions and the sensory transduction thereof. When you decide to move your head, the **efferent copy** of that **descending motor command** provides the earliest signal about what is going to happen, setting off a complex cascade of subsequent signals that all need to be accounted for ([[#figure_env]]).

Your spinal cord and skeletal muscles do a lot of further work to actually implement the motor command in an efficient way, so you need to also get the actual **ascending motor signals** back up from the lower-level spinal motor pathways and the associated **proprioceptive** signals about the current levels of muscle stretching from the muscle _spindle fibers_. These signals unfold over time as the motor action takes place, even if the descending motor command was relatively ballistic.

Then, as your head starts to move, you will start getting signals from your vestibular system reflecting the motion. The specific spatiotemporal pattern of these signals will depend on the exact motor parameters, so this is a further challenging prediction problem. As shown in [[#figure_env]], the adaptive filtering job performed by the cerebellum can be organized around the entire _temporal envelope_ defined by the initial descending motor command.

{id="figure_cancel" style="height:20em"}
![The prediction of the sensory consequences of a motor action can be subtracted from the original sensory signal to cancel the sensory signal. If there is an external perturbation of the sensory signal that does not fit the prediction, then there is a residual signal that clearly reveals the exact parameters of the perturbation, untangled from the sensory signals generated by the motor command.](media/fig_cerebellum_sensory_cancellation.png)

The core computation performed by the adaptive filter is to subtract the learned prediction of the sensory consequences of a motor action from the actual sensory inputs ([[#figure_cancel]]). If the actual sensory inputs match the learned prediction, then the result is _cancellation_ of the sensory signal. However, if there is a perturbation of the sensory signal from something else unexpectedly going on (a slip, a push, etc), then this will show up clearly as a _residual_ signal that has not been canceled by the prediction.

A further wrinkle with this cancellation process is that it must slightly anticipate the sensory signal in order to account for the synaptic delays in the cancellation signal itself. There is extensive evidence of roughly 50 to 100 ms anticipatory firing of various predictive signals in the vestibular and other pathways ([[@Cullen23]]).

Anticipatory firing is relatively straightforward to accomplish via synaptic plasticity mechanisms that drive learning based on chemical traces that reflect input activity with a given temporal lag ([[@RaymondLisberger98]]; [[@WangDenkHausser00]]). Indeed, these chemical processes (see [[synaptic plasticity]]) generally require multiple stages of integration that naturally build in such delays, such that the input signals driving learning represent the earlier inputs from 50 to 100 ms before.

<!--- TODO: cites from Verduzco -->

### Forward models

In addition to the inhibitory cancellation process, the learned sensory prediction signals themselves are directly valuable in supporting motor control, because they provide anticipatory information about the sensory outcomes of motor actions. This anticipatory prediction of sensory outcomes is known as a **forward model** ([[@JordanRumelhart92]]), which has long been hypothesized as a critical aspect of cerebellar processing ([[@MiallWolpert96]]; [[@Bastian06]]; [[@TanakaIshikawaLeeEtAl20]]).

The distinction between a forward model and the adaptive filter is critical, but often under-appreciated in the literature, because both share the common element of predictive learning of sensory signals. A forward model uses predictive signals to directly drive motor actions based on anticipated states, whereas an adaptive filter _removes_ these predicted signals from the sensory states.

The adaptive filter requires increased inhibition in proportion to the predicted sensory signal to drive the cancellation, whereas the forward model signal should go in the opposite direction, to be proportional to the sensory prediction. Both should be driven by a common predictive learning mechanism.

One clear example of these two functions operating on the same vestibular signal is the adaptive filtering of head motion to subtract from the vestibular signal ([[@Cullen23]]), versus the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) where eye movements are generated to correct for head motion, to keep a visual stimulus stable on the retina ([[@ZeeuwHanselBianEtAl98]]; [[@KimpoRinaldiKimEtAl14]]; see [[VOR simulation]]). The VOR requires ocular motor actions to be generated in anticipation of the effects of head motion actions, which requires the forward model predictions.

To be able to anticipate sensory signals and respond as quickly as possible, the cerebellar circuits all operate in parallel, so the adaptive filtering and forward model functions, though logically related, operate via separate loops, in parallel. It would be too slow for the VOR ocular actions to be generated by sequentially feeding a signal from the adaptive filtering circuit back into another cerebellar circuit for the VOR.

The cerebellum is organized to support the conflicting demands of adaptive filtering and forward models, in parallel. The cerebellar nuclei directly implement the common predictive learning aspect, but also send a prediction error signal to the cerebellar cortex via their inputs into the inferior olivary nuclei. Critically, this IO error signal can drive different directions of plasticity in different cortical zones, known as **upbound** and **downbound microzones** ([[@DeZeeuw21]]). These different zones can then support both the adaptive filtering and forward model functions, respectively.

### Nuclear circuitry

{id="figure_nuclear" style="height:20em"}
![Cerebellar components that implement the adaptive filter computation according to the Nuclear model. In the cerebellar nucleus (CN), paired inhibitory (CNi) and excitatory (CNe) neurons operate on a specific sensory channel, with sample activity over time as shown. The CNi learns to predict the sensory input activity, and successful prediction results in stable activity over the CNe output (projection) neuron, with excitatory sensory input balanced by corresponding inhibition from both the CNi and the PC (Purkinje cell). The CNe has a high (~40 Hz) tonic baseline firing rate, as does the PC. The IO (inferior olive) compares the CNi prediction vs. the sensory input, and fires a burst of spikes if there is an excitatory input without a corresponding inhibitory input. This leads to complex spike firing in the PC, and can drive plasticity in the CNi.](media/fig_cerebellum_as_adaptive_filter.png)

The key elements of the cerebellar circuitry that can implement this adaptive filter process according to the _Nuclear_ model are shown in [[#figure_nuclear]]. Even though each element in this model has been discussed in the literature, the specific details have not otherwise all been combined into one coherent framework. These points of comparison are discussed in the [[#Standard models]] section below, after providing an overview of the Nuclear framework.

* Each specific sensory channel (e.g., one particular canal in the vestibular system) has an anatomically organized pathway that specifically learns to predict it, based on the microzone organization ([[@Oscarsson79]]; [[@SugiharaShinoda04]]; [[@HawkesLeclerc87]]; [[@DeZeeuw21]]). The specific sensory input drives excitatory input into _glomeruli_ (relatively large anatomical structures where multiple axons and dendrites converge) on **inferior olive (IO)** neurons.  An associated **cerebellar nucleus (CN)** inhibitory (GABAergic) neuron (_CNi_) projects inhibition into the same IO glomerulus, representing the learned prediction of the specific sensory channel. By detecting the coincidence of excitatory and inhibitory inputs within a narrow time window, the IO glomerulus can compute the _prediction error_ ([[@Ito13]]; [[@DeZeeuwSimpsonHoogenraadEtAl98]]).

    Each IO neuron has about 50 such glomeruli, each of which receives 2 excitatory and 2 inhibitory inputs ([[@DeZeeuwSimpsonHoogenraadEtAl98]]). Each glomerulus connects about 5-6 different nearby IO neurons together, with gap junctions that cause them to be synchronized. Thus, there are about 5-6 IO neurons processing each specific sensory input projection, with likely redundancy in sampling the same specific sensory channel across cerebellar _microzones_.
    
    The error detection logic in the IO glomeruli operates by virtue of inhibitory inputs resetting intrinsic dendritic conductances, such that excitatory inputs are ineffective within a ~50-100 ms window, but are strongly amplified outside of that window, so that even a few spikes outside of the window can drive supra-threshold burst activity in the IO neuron ([[@LoyolaHooglandHoedemakerEtAl23]]). This time window offset within the IO can support an anticipatory predictive signal in the predictive input: the predictive inhibition can precede the excitatory sensory signal by roughly 50-100ms. If inhibitory input occurs without a corresponding excitatory input, the neuron remains inhibited for a corresponding time window.
    
    The complex combination of intrinsic currents in the IO neuron result in a baseline activity level of about 1 Hz, with the relative balance and timing of inhibitory and excitatory inputs determining the probability, timing, and intensity of its spiking, which is known to vary systematically according to the relevant training conditions ([[@TitleyKislinSimmonsEtAl19]]; [[@ZangDeSchutter19]]; [[@GuoUusisaari25]]; [[@YangLisberger14]]). Even this low baseline activity rate provides a meaningful graded, bidirectional error signal, with the consistent presence or absence of IO firing associated with sensory inputs driving opposite directions of synaptic plasticity, at least in some well-documented cases ([[@OhmaeMedina15]]; [[@YangLisberger14a]]).
    
    It is likely that the gap-junction driven synchronization of multiple IO neurons is an essential component of the error signal efficacy, with synchronized activity or inhibition across a population providing the relevant graded, bidirectional error signal ([[@HoangTsutsumiMatsuzakiEtAl23]]; [[@GiessenKoekkoekDorpEtAl08]]). This gap junction connectivity can provide a mechanism for organizing a group of related neurons around a common initial motor action signal that defines the temporal envelope ([[#figure_env]]).

* The IO prediction error signal drives learning in the **Purkinje cells (PC)**, which are the primary output neurons of the _cerebellar cortex_.  Each IO neuron sends _climbing fiber (CF)_ axonal output that goes up to the PCs, and also back down to the CN. Each IO neuron sends CF output to about 10 PC neurons, with about 300 synapses per PC neuron ([[@Ito84]]). The IO spikes drive powerful _complex spike_ activity patterns in the PC neurons that trigger learning in these neurons ([[@ItoKano82]]; [[@CoesmansWeberDeZeeuwEtAl04]]; [[@GaovanBeugenDeZeeuw12]]; [[@SilvaRamirez-BuriticaPritchettEtAl24]]). 

* The PC neurons send GABA inhibition to the CN, strongly targeting the excitatory projection neurons (_CNe_), which convey the primary output of the entire cerebellar system. Both the PC and CNe neurons fire at a high tonic baseline level (roughly 40-50 Hz), due to intrinsic channel properties, which allows for significant bidirectional modulation of their firing rates. Thus, in the adaptive filtering context, an IO-driven complex spike reflecting unpredicted sensory excitation should drive LTP (long-term potentiation) in the PC neurons, which would then increase the amount of inhibition they send to the CNe neurons, thereby balancing out the additional excitatory drive from the sensory input and canceling the sensory signal.

    For the bidirectional opposite case where there is an absence of expected excitatory sensory input to the IO, the systematic absence of IO spiking should drive LTD (long-term depression) in the PC neurons, decreasing the amount of inhibition onto the CNe neurons ([[@CoesmansWeberDeZeeuwEtAl04]]; [[@GaovanBeugenDeZeeuw12]]; [[@DeZeeuw21]]).

    
<!--- TODO: Brooks et al -->
    
* The CNi neurons need to learn to predict the specific sensory input in order to make the IO computation an accurate prediction error signal. Consistent with this account, direct evidence shows that this CNi projection is responsible for reducing IO firing and complex spikes in PC neurons as learning proceeds ([[@KimKrupaThompson98]]; [[@Ito01]]). Furthermore, this pathway was responsible for a _blocking_ effect in conditioned learning, which is a signature of the elimination of prediction error signals in a delta-rule like mechanism ([[@Fanselow98]]; [[@KimKrupaThompson98]]).

    The learning in CNi neurons may also be influenced by input from the PC into the CNi neurons ([[@PughRaman08]]; [[@YangLisberger14]]; [[@HerzfeldHallTringidesEtAl20]]). However, unlike the CNe neurons, it is important that the CNi neurons not receive too much inhibition from the PC neurons, as this would then reduce their prediction signal, creating more of a prediction error. This requirement is consistent with evidence showing that PC inhibitory inputs onto CNi neurons are relatively weak and synapse on distal dendrites, while PC to CNe projections are strong and synapse near the soma ([[@UusisaariKnopfel08]]).

<!--- TODO: key data from [[@DeZeeuwBerrebi95]] on PC inputs to CN, and likely independence of CNi vs. CNe -- key prediction and alternative models. -->
    
* The inputs for driving the PC (and other neurons in the cerebellar cortex) and the CNi neurons are conveyed by the **mossy fiber (MF)** pathway originating in the **pontine nuclei (PN)**. This broad sample of time-varying inputs allows the PC and CNi neurons to generate a prediction of the time-varying specific sensory input.

    The cerebellar cortex also contains a very large number of tiny **granule cells (GC)**, that receive MF inputs and send excitation to the PCs, via distinctive _parallel fiber_ axons, with each PC receiving 150,000 or more parallel fiber inputs. The large number of these GCs result in the cerebellum having about 70% of the total number of neurons in the human brain. These GCs, along with inhibitory _Golgi_ cells and other specialized cell types in some areas, are thought to provide a very high-dimensional time-varying representation that is particularly useful for rapidly learning novel temporal firing patterns in the PC neurons ([[@Marr69]]; [[@BuonomanoMauk94]]; [[@MaukBuonomano04]]).

* To support the forward model functionality of driving motor actions based on sensory predictions (instead of canceling sensory signals in the adaptive filtering case), the predictive signal from the CNi neurons needs to be projected outside of the CN, but there is no obvious way for the CNi neurons to directly communicate their activity as an output of the cerebellum. These are small neurons that only project inhibition to the IO and locally to the CNi neurons ([[@UusisaariKnopfel08]]). Therefore, the most plausible mechanism is for the IO prediction error signal to drive the _opposite sign_ of synaptic plasticity in the PC neurons, so that this sign reversal of their inhibitory effect on CNe neurons results in a net excitatory CNe signal to drive motor actions.

    This opposite sign of PC plasticity corresponds to LTD occuring when there is an IO-driven complex spike, and LTP occuring in the systematic absence of such IO spiking. This is the pattern of plasticity predicted by the [[@^Albus71]] and [[@^Ito72]] motor learning theories, which has been extensively demonstrated and analyzed ([[@Ito01]]; [[@CoesmansWeberDeZeeuwEtAl04]]; [[@GaovanBeugenDeZeeuw12]]; [[@YangLisberger14a]]; [[@SilvaRamirez-BuriticaPritchettEtAl24]]). Thus, despite the dominance of this directionality of plasticity in the literature, the differential _upbound_ vs _downbound_ microzones proposed by [[@^DeZeeuw21]] provide a way to support both the adaptive filtering and forward model mechanisms, as further discussed below. 
    
    For the forward model case (and _not_ the adaptive filter one), plasticity in the CNe neurons could consolidate the initial learning in the cerebellar cortex, to provide a slower integration of the reliable forward model predictions over time. This is consistent with data showing CN plasticity in forward-model learning paradigms ([[@MedinaLisberger08]]; [[@KimpoRinaldiKimEtAl14]]; [[@YangLisberger14a]]; [[@HerzfeldHallTringidesEtAl20]]) along with direct tests of CN plasticity in slices ([[@PughRaman08]]; [[@PughRaman06]]; [[@ZhangLinden06]]; [[@McElvainBagnallSakatosEtAl10]]).

In summary, this model shows how the elaborate and specialized nature of the cerebellar circuitry seems ideal for performing the adaptive filter and forward model functionality, consistent with major longstanding hypotheses ([[@Fujita82a]]; [[@MiallWolpert96]]; [[@Bastian06]]; [[@DeanPorrillEkerotEtAl10]]; [[@TanakaIshikawaLeeEtAl20]]; [[@Cullen23]]).

The presence of two distinct pathways for canceling the sensory signal, a direct pathway within the CN and an indirect pathway through the cerebellar cortex, raises the question as to why two separate pathways would be useful, and how they might perform complementary functions. Taking inspiration from the seminal ideas of David Marr for both the [[hippocampus]] ([[@Marr71]]) and the cerebellum ([[@Marr69]]), one hypothesis is that the use of a very high-dimensional representational space in the cerebellar cortex (via the GCs) allows the system to rapidly learn new spatiotemporal firing patterns without suffering from extensive interference with prior learning.

Furthermore, the CN system can slowly learn the most reliable and stable forms of sensory predictions, while the cerebellar cortex can rapidly learn more context-dependent, idiosyncratic predictions, which may then decay away over time ([[@HerzfeldHallTringidesEtAl20]]; [[@KimpoRinaldiKimEtAl14]]; [[@KassardjianTanChungEtAl05]]). In short, the CN slowly learns the _rules_, while the cerebellar cortex can quickly learn the _exceptions_, just as in the complementary learning systems framework for the hippocampus vs neocortex ([[@McClellandMcNaughtonOReilly95]]; [[@OReillyRudy01]]; [[@NormanOReilly03]]).

There is evidence that the CN pathway does not have as accurate of timing relative to the cortical pathway ([[@GarciaSteeleMauk99]]), which is consistent with the high-dimensional representation formed in the cerebellar cortex. Because each PC integrates input from roughly 150,000 granule cell inputs, it can form novel, arbitrary associations across many more diverse stimulus inputs than the more limited dendritic arbors of CNi neurons. Thus, the CN learns coarser timing while the cerebellar cortex learns fine-grained timing.

A number of studies are consistent with rapid one-trial learning in the cerebellar cortex ([[@MedinaLisberger08]]; [[@KimpoRinaldiKimEtAl14]]; [[@YangLisberger14a]]; [[@HerzfeldHallTringidesEtAl20]]). These studies also demonstrate the rapid decay of the strongest synaptic changes that occur on a single trial, but are also consistent with considerable evidence of long-lasting changes in the cerebellar cortex synapses as well ([[@SilvaRamirez-BuriticaPritchettEtAl24]]; [[@Ito01]]; [[@WangNakadateMasugi-TokitaEtAl14]]).

There is a significant mismatch between the stimulation paradigms used in most synaptic plasticity studies conducted in slices ([[@Ito01]]; [[@Ito13]]) and those demonstrating rapid but transient changes in awake behaving animals ([[@MedinaLisberger08]]; [[@KimpoRinaldiKimEtAl14]]), which could account for the lack of focus on these dynamics in the broader cerebellar synaptic plasticity literature.

## Learning rules

There is biological evidence for [[synaptic plasticity]] in just about every synapse in the cerebellar system ([[@HanselLindenDAngelo01]]; [[@Carey11]]; [[@GaovanBeugenDeZeeuw12]]). The most important synapses based on the logic of [[#figure_cereb]] are:

* CNi predictor inputs.
* PC inputs.

### CNi learning

Starting with the CNi prediction neuron, a simple [[error-backpropagation#delta-rule]] function is optimal from a mathematical perspective:

{id="eq_delta-w" title="Delta rule"}
$$
\Delta w = (s - y) x
$$

where _y_ is the prediction activity, _s_ is the sensory value, and _x_ is the sending activity. 

This equation requires bidirectional learning based on the mismatch between the sensory value and prediction: if the prediction is too low, then the synaptic weights need to be increased (LTP), and decreased (LTD) in the opposite case.  There is direct evidence for bidirectional synaptic plasticity in CN neurons ([[@PughRaman08]]; [[@PughRaman06]]; [[@ZhangLinden06]]; [[@McElvainBagnallSakatosEtAl10]]). However, these experiments were conducted in slices, which creates interpretational difficulties. In particular, the _in vitro_ slice preparation exhibits rebound bursting that is likely not present in awake behaving animals (i.e., [[in activo]]), and this bursting was a focus of these studies.

In the absence of definitive data, one possible learning mechanism that could implement [[#eq_delta-w]] is to separate the specific sensory input being predicted from the broader mossy-fiber signals used to learn the prediction, with learning based on the difference between them. For example, the predicted input could synapse onto the soma (or proximal dendrites) with relatively weak, non-plastic synapses, while the MF inputs are distributed across the dendritic arbor. The results and theorizing summarized by [[@^PughRaman08]] are potentially consistent with this idea, demonstrating distinct contributions from somatic and dendritic activity, based on differential localization of Ca++ channels.

There is a general consensus in the field that initial faster learning in the PC neurons is necessary for the _systems consolidation_ of slower learning in the CN ([[@RaymondMedina18]]; [[@HerzfeldHallTringidesEtAl20]]). However, each of the relevant studies supporting this conclusion has issues that leave this point in doubt, suggesting that learning in the CN can proceed independently from the PC inputs, but that these PC inputs may also facilitate learning when present.

Perhaps the strongest-seeming data comes from [[@^GarciaSteeleMauk99]], who lesioned the cerebral cortex post-learning in an [[eyeblink simulation|conditioning]] paradigm, and found that this lesion prevented subsequent acquisition to a new CS. However, this is could actually have been due to a blocking effect from the prior CS-US conditioning, as was found by [[@^KimKrupaThompson98]].

Another study by [[@^ZeeuwHanselBianEtAl98]] used a genetic knockout to disable a critical protein kinase involved in [[synaptic plasticity]], selectively in the PC neurons. Although they found that this blocked adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in both the PCs and the CN, they only used a short amount of training (1 hr) which was shown in another study to only affect learning in the cerebral cortex ([[@KassardjianTanChungEtAl05]]).

Consistent with the fast vs. slow dissociation, [[@^KassardjianTanChungEtAl05]] only found cortically-independent learning in the CN after 3 days of training. Furthermore, [[@^ZeeuwHanselBianEtAl98]] noted that the standard VOR, and considerable motor behavior, was intact in their knockout mice, providing strong evidence that plasticity in the PC is _not_ important for the slow learning over developmental time in the CN.

Another study by [[@^ShutohOhkiKitazawaEtAl06]] used a range of manipulations, and did show that the inactivation of the IO affected longer-term VOR adaptation, and a blocker of learning-related chemical cascades in the cerebellar cortex impaired learning in the CN. These results are inconsistent with long-term learning in the  [[@^ZeeuwHanselBianEtAl98]] study, and further careful research is needed to resolve these discrepancies (see also [[@Ito13]]).

Overall, given the strong functional benefits of direct CNi learning, it seems reasonable to assume for the time being that the CNi can learn independent of the cerebellar cortex, and that this learning is significantly slower than learning in the PC neurons. The PC projections to CNi neurons may also facilitate learning ([[@HerzfeldHallTringidesEtAl20]]), while the IO collaterals may also play a critical modulatory role.

The IO inputs uniquely provide a direct source of information about the balance of inhibition and excitation with the IO that generates the error signal conveyed to the PC neurons, so it is likely an important modulator of CNi learning. The strong computational imperative for [[#eq_delta-w]] at least provides a testable set of predictions, in the absence of strong empirical data at this point.

### PC learning

The role of the IO climbing fiber activity in shaping learning in the PC via complex spikes has been much more extensively studied ([[@Ito01]]; [[@CoesmansWeberDeZeeuwEtAl04]]; [[@GaovanBeugenDeZeeuw12]]), consistent with the general focus on the cerebellar cortex since the original highly-influential theories of [[@^Marr69]], [[@^Albus71]], and [[@^Ito72]]. Recent data confirms considerable earlier research on PC learning that the climbing fiber input from the IO is critical for PC plasticity ([[@SilvaRamirez-BuriticaPritchettEtAl24]]).

{id="figure_up-down" style="height:40em"}
![Plasticity in upbound vs downbound microzones, according to the framework of De Zeeuw (2021). In upbound microzones (which stain positive for zebrin II, also known as ALDOC), complex spikes driven by IO climbing fiber inputs drive learning that increases the rate of simple spike output (normal PC spiking activity). This is consistent with adaptive filtering, which needs to cancel out the predicted sensory signals, with increased PC inhibition. In downbound microzones, these complex spikes drive decreases in PC simple spiking, consistent with forward models that use anticipatory predictive signals to drive motor actions. The molecular layer interneurons (MLI; previously called stellate or basket cells) contribute to these patterns of plasticity. There are also differences in baseline firing rates associated with these different microzones (upbound have lower and downbound have higher).](media/fig_cerebellum_up_down_microzones_dezeeuw_21.png)

As discussed above, the bidirectional modulation of IO spiking and associated graded climbing fiber activity, modulated by population-level gap-junction synchronization, appears to be capable of driving bidirectional plasticity in PC neurons ([[@CoesmansWeberDeZeeuwEtAl04]]; [[@GaovanBeugenDeZeeuw12]]; [[@DeZeeuw21]]). The directionality of this plasticity should be opposite for the upbound vs downbound microzones ([[@DeZeeuw21]]; [[@TangXiaoSuhEtAl17]]), to support both adaptive filtering and forward model learning ([[#figure_up-down]]).

According to the adaptive filter cancellation logic, a positive error with more sensory excitation vs. predictive inhibition should result in an increased amount of inhibition on the sensory signal, i.e., LTP of the PC synapses so they send more simple-spike inhibition into the CNe neurons. Thus, this case follows the same [[#eq_delta-w]] logic as the CNi learning. For the forward model case, the sign of learning should be reversed (i.e., LTD for unexpected sensory excitation, causing an IO spike), so that the net effect is PC disinhibition of CNe neurons to communicate a positive sensory prediction signal.

The LTD associated with IO climbing fiber activity is is the most widely studied form of PC plasticity, consistent with the majority of learning paradigms being focused on cases where a motor output is learned, versus the adaptive filtering case which is somewhat more difficult to measure. Furthermore, the prevalence of this direction of plasticity is consistent with the lesser area of zebrin II staining as shown in [[#figure_mossy-prjn]]: there are more forward-model (zebrin negative) than adaptive filtering (zebrin positive) microzones in the cerebellum. This is also consistent with the idea that the number of sensory channels that need to be adaptively filtered is less than the number of different motor actions that benefit from predictive forward-model learning.

[[@^DeZeeuw21]] provides examples of upbound and downbound learning in various well-studied domains, and argues that the number of inhibitory synapses involved determines the directionality (odd number = upbound, even number = downbound). However, he does not directly connect this distinction to the adaptive filtering vs. forward model frameworks. The polarity of the output pathway is probably the more general principle for more complex forward model cases (e.g., there could be a triple-negative forward model case that requires upbound learning), but the direct inhibitory cancellation of sensory inputs in the adaptive filtering case is the prototypical and evolutionarily primordial example of upbound learning.

The strong spatial organization of these microzones might be specific to rodents, with primates showing a more intermixed structure ([[@HaoZhuHuangEtAl24]]), which could explain various differences across these species (e.g., compare [[@KimpoRinaldiKimEtAl14]] in monkeys vs. [[@VogesWuPostEtAl17]] in mice).

There are well-documented cases across multiple paradigms that show strong asymmetries in the directionality of learning, in forward-model based paradigms involving a motor output. For example, in a very thorough study of the VOR (vestibulo-ocular reflex) paradigm, only increases in VOR gain exhibited rapid trial-by-trial adjustments, that were consistent with LTD of the PC climbing fiber synapses ([[@KimpoRinaldiKimEtAl14]]). Nevertheless long-term changes in behavior and PC firing were appropriately bidirectional, suggesting that the asymmetry was restricted to rapid, transient changes. There may be general functional benefits to this asymmetry that can be investigated with computational models.

A directional saccade task also showed the same kind of asymmetry in rapid learning, which was also dissociated from the bidirectional plasticity in longer-term learning ([[@YangLisberger14a]]). The widely-studied eyeblink conditioning task has shown more ambiguous results on the directionality of learning ([[@McCormickThompson84a]]; [[@BerthierMoore86]]; [[@JirenhedBengtssonHesslow07]]; [[@GreenSteinmetz05]]), perhaps consistent with a mix of both forward model and adaptive filter modes of learning.

There are a number of additional factors that have been identified in driving plasticity in the overall PC simple spike responses, including changes in the nature of the mossy-fiber inputs, and plasticity in the molecular layer interneurons that inhibit PC neurons ([[@BonnanZhangGaffieldEtAl23]]; [[@ZhangYangGaffieldEtAl23]]). Some of these factors likely modulate PC learning so it only occurs in response to meaningful IO spikes and not to the regular 1 Hz background spiking ([[@ZangDeSchutter19]]; [[@GuoUusisaari25]]). 

## Standard models

There have been a large number of different theoretical accounts of cerebellar function over the years (see [[@NguyenPerson25]]; [[@Shadmehr20]]; [[@RaymondMedina18]] for recent reviews). Most of these models have focused on the circuits in the cerebellar cortex, with relatively little attention paid to those in the CN ([[@KebschullCasoniConsalezEtAl24]]; [[@HerzfeldHallTringidesEtAl20]]). In this section, we review some key points of divergence among the various theories, in relation to the Nuclear framework presented above.

At a broad level, the adaptive filtering and forward model functionality supported by the Nuclear model is consistent with longstanding and widely-discussed principles of cerebellar function ([[@Fujita82a]]; [[@MiallWolpert96]]; [[@Bastian06]]; [[@DeanPorrillEkerotEtAl10]]; [[@TanakaIshikawaLeeEtAl20]]; [[@Cullen23]]). Nevertheless, the Nuclear model provides a very specific, mechanistic account for the origin and nature of the predictive error signal in the IO, and for the roles of the different neurons within the cerebellar nuclei, that have not been fully integrated in prior accounts. Furthermore, the precise distinction between adaptive filtering and forward model learning, and their need for differential directions of plasticity in relation to the IO climbing fiber signals, has not been previously articulated as such.

The greatest source of remaining uncertainty and overall confusion in the literature concerns the role of the cerebellum in more flexible, open-ended motor control. Many have assumed that the cerebellum can manage core aspects of this functionality all on its own, which then requires considerably more complex and difficult computational problems to be solved (e.g., [[@Kawato99]], [[@Llinas09]]). However, many lines of evidence strongly suggest that such abilities require the coordinated interactions among multiple brain areas including the [[basal ganglia]] and the [[prefrontal cortex]], as reviewed in the [[motor]] page. Thus, by putting the cerebellum into a broader context of different neural systems, each specialized for one well-defined type of neural computation and learning, we can perhaps arrive at a more satisfying overall understanding.

### Nature of the IO error signal

It is interesting that although most discussions of cerebellar function depict the IO as performing an error computation, and a number of papers discuss both the prediction error coding and these detailed biological properties (e.g., [[@LoyolaHooglandHoedemakerEtAl23]]; [[@DeZeeuwSimpsonHoogenraadEtAl98]]), none have articulated the direct and explicit connection between the unique biological properties of the IO neurons and this error computation.

The summary of the IO error signals and learning across the many eyeblink conditioning studies provided by [[@^OhmaeMedina15]] has been highlighted as demonstrating a novel form of error computation in the IO ([[@Hull20]]; [[@NguyenPerson25]]). However, these properties are all consistent with the delta rule learning algorithm hypothesized for the CNi prediction learning pathway ([[#eq_delta-w]]). This equation is otherwise known as the Rescorla-Wagner learning rule ([[@RescorlaWagner72]]), originally used to explain a wide range of conditioning phenomena associated with phasic dopamine firing (see [[PVLV]] for further discussion). The only aspect of this learning that is potentially challenging is the CS-based responding, but this is consistent with the anticipatory bias of cerebellar predictive learning.

{id="figure_raymond-medina" style="height:25em"}
![Diagram of cerebellar function from Raymond & Medina (2018), showing the critical IO error signal computed as a difference between the actual response and a "desired response". The origin and nature of this "desired response" is unclear, representing a critical weakness in most standard accounts of cerebellar function.](media/fig_cerebellum_model_raymond_medina_18.png)

In contrast to the well-defined, biologically-explicit mechanism in the Nuclear model for computing a sensory prediction error, most other treatments of this essential aspect of cerebellar function are notably vague, as illustrated in [[#figure_raymond-medina]] from [[@^RaymondMedina18]]. How and where does the brain compute something as omniscient as a "desired response"? And if such a thing is available, why not just use it directly, instead of making undesired responses in the first place?

A necessary step for making the error signal directly computable is to define it in terms of sensory outcomes, because these are the concrete outcome signals that project into the cerebellum. However, because the cerebellum is involved in motor control, people naturally want to think in terms of motor errors, not sensory errors. This is where the problems arise: it is really unclear how to define a "motor error", as discussed next.

### Motor space is messy, sensory is clean

The fundamental problem with motor control, and thinking in terms of representations in motor control space, is that it is a very messy place. Specifically, there is a massive one-to-many relationship between the desired outcome of a motor action and the actual muscle movements necessary to accomplish that outcome, depending on a huge number of variables that are generally different for each such action. Consider reaching for a cup on the table. The precise motor actions needed to successfully accomplish this simple action depend on the initial position of each joint in your arm, the postural configuration of the rest of your body (e.g., standing or sitting, and exactly how in relation to factors such as balance), the physical properties of the cup, the fatigue state of your muscles, etc. Each of these factors interact, creating a massive [[curse of dimensionality|combinatorial explosion]] problem.

For this reason, it is much simpler to drive motor control in sensory space ([[@Powers73]]), where both the targets of motor actions and their outcomes are all encoded in a much lower-dimensional, more systematic representational space. Thus, when you reach for the cup, the visual, somatosensory, and proprioceptive signals tell you whether the action was successful, and in what direction it was off, etc.

Furthermore, the adaptive filtering process can systematically clean up the sensory space, so that all of the factors mentioned above (starting joint angles, posture, balance, etc) have already been subtracted from the relevant sensory signals. Therefore, the motor planning based on this filtered sensory space is much more systematic and lower-dimensional.

This sensory-based framework contrasts with the attempt to invert a forward model to obtain an _inverse model_ ([[@JordanRumelhart92]]; [[@Kawato99]]), which in principle tells you what motor commands are needed to obtain a given sensory outcome (recall that the forward model goes the other way, predicting the sensory outcome of a motor command). For all the reasons discussed above, it is quite difficult to create an inverse model in complex, real-world cases, because there are often many possible action sequences that could result in the same or similar outcomes ([[@JordanRumelhart92]]; [[@GibsonFichmanPlaut97]]).

Further insight into problems with motor-based frameworks comes from a consideration of the predictive error signals computed by the IO, which have been proposed to be based on efferent copy inputs ([[@Oscasson80]]; [[@KawatoGomi92]]). [[@^SimpsonWylieZeeuw96]] note that the inputs tend to be dominated by somatosensory and proprioceptive signals, and not efferent copy inputs, and that there is a timing issue for motor error computation, where the temporal separation between the initial motor command efferent copy and the subsequent motor outcome can be relatively long (more than 100 ms, as shown in [[#figure_env]]). Furthermore, there is an anatomical mismatch between descending and ascending motor pathways as they map into the cerebellum ([[@DeZeeuwSimpsonHoogenraadEtAl98]]).

## Summary

In summary, sensory predictive learning and adaptive filtering provide a fully computationally well-defined framework that is consistent with known cerebellar properties (as articulated in the Nuclear model above). _If_ it is possible to implement functional motor control using just this adaptive filtering functionality to provide high-quality sensory signals upon which motor actions can be based, then many otherwise challenging difficulties disappear. The broader framework provided in the [[motor]] page, and implemented computational models that include the function of the [[basal ganglia]] and [[prefrontal cortex]], demonstrate that this is indeed possible.

Furthermore, the [[Rubicon]] goal-driven control framework provides a critical outer-loop infrastructure for motor action selection to accomplish desired goal outcomes. This system uses a sensory-based goal selection mechanism, informed by multiple levels of predictive learning systems and shaped by [[constraint satisfaction]] processing across learned [[distributed representations]], to select a desired outcome and an overall plan of action. This goal-selection process can be informed by cerebellar predictive learning mechanisms, but does not require inverting forward models to obtain the inverse model.
