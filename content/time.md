**Time** is an inevitable part of everything that happens in the brain, and it is represented in many different ways across different brain areas, with no evidence of a single central "clock". Perhaps the closest to such a thing is the _theta rhythm_ which is a prominent timing signal at ~5 Hz (200 ms period) coordinated across wide areas of the [[space|spatial]] processing networks including the [[hippocampus]]. However, there are many other timing systems in the brain. The massive array of granule cells in the [[cerebellum]] are widely thought to provide a high-resolution timing mechanism for coordinating motor actions, and dynamic activity patterns in the [[prefrontal cortex]] monitor progress toward accomplishing goals.

There is considerable evidence that people use representations of [[space]] in the parietal lobe to reason about time, and in general, the slippery nature of time is often rendered more concrete by turning it into a [[distributed representation]] encoded across a population of neurons, effectively _spatializing_ time. The [[large language models]] for example take this approach to the extreme by encoding large streams of text across increasingly large _context_ input layers, used to predict the next word in that language stream.

## Theta rhythm

The [[theta rhythm]] (~5 Hz, 200 ms period) is generated in the brainstem _ventral tegmental nucleus (VTN)_ (of Gudden) and the _medial mammillary bodies_ (MMB) to which it connects. From there, this timing signal spreads widely to the medial temporal lobe and the [[hippocampus]].
