The **superior colliculus** (SC) is the [[evolution]]ary expansion of the **tectum** in mammals, and can be thought of as the subcortical, evolutionarily primary version of the [[neocortex]], by integrating various sensory inputs to drive more complex motor behavior. Whereas the neocortex is much more strongly shaped by [[synaptic plasticity]] (learning), the SC is more strongly shaped by evolution and is thought to be a major locus of innate behavior. Whereas the SC is primarily driven by visual input (i.e., the _optic tectum_ in non-mammalian species), the the **inferior colliculus** (IC) is primarily driven by auditory input (i.e., the _auditory tectum_). The two are densely interconnected and the same overall principles apply to both structures.

The SC has massive interconnectivity with every other major network in the brain [[@BenavidezBienkowskiZhuEtAl21]], including the [[neocortex]], [[basal ganglia]], [[cerebellum]] and the [[motor]] brainstem and spinal cord. It sends sensory signals to the [[amygdala]] and [[acetylcholine]] (ACh) areas that then drive neuromodulation of the entire brain, consistent with the [[Rubicon]] model.

One of the most well-studied aspects of SC functionality is in driving eye movements (saccades) toward spatial targets. The retinotopically-organized **superficial layers** of the SC receive direct input from the retina and visual areas of neocortex, and project into the **intermediate** and **deep** layers that contain motor output neurons that directly drive eye movements. These deeper layers receive extensive input from the SNr of the basal ganglia, along with many other subcortical and motor cortical inputs, which can then modulate and contextualize the motor outputs.
