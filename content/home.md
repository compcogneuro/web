See [book.compcogneuro.org](https://book.compcogneuro.org) for the textbook _Computational Cognitive Neuroscience, 5th Edition_ and associated simulations.

This site hosts a growing library of interactive documentation and simulations based on the [[Axon]] framework, which is the successor to the [[Leabra]] framework used in the above textbook. Axon features discrete spiking instead of the rate code activations used in [[Leabra]], and supports the [[Rubicon]] systems-neuroscience model of goal-driven learning and cognition.

An _in progress_ [[intro book|introductory textbook]] pathway through this new content is available, as an updated version of the original CCN textbook.

This work is supported primarily by the [Astera Institute](https://astera.org/) (Randall O'Reilly & Thomas Hazy), the University of California Davis (O'Reilly and Yuko Munakata), and Brown University (Michael Frank).
