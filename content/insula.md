The **insula** is the primary sensory area in the [[neocortex]] that receives **interoceptive** and somatosensory signals associated with taste, touch, pain, etc. It projects extensively to the _orbitofrontal cortex (OFC)_ to drive representations of desired outcomes in the goal-driven [[Rubicon]] framework. Given the core survival-relevant nature of this sensory information, it plays a critical role in [[emotion]], particularly in the [[conscious awareness]] of internal body states, which otherwise are extensively processed in subcortical areas that lack the [[bidirectional connectivity]] of the neocortex, and thus are not part of our subjective states of awareness.
